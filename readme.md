A brief introduction to logistic regression.

This lesson explains why logistic regression is a useful machine learning algorithm. It walks through the the formula for logistic regression and how to make a prediction with a trained logistic regression model. It then discusses what type of decision boundary logistic regression learns. Finally, discusses when and when not to use logistic regression.
