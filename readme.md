A brief introduction to logistic regression.

Logistic regression is one of the most useful machine learning algorithms, serving both as a compelling baseline and the fundamental building block of deep learning. This lesson provides a general introduction to logistic regression. First, walking through the formula for logistic regression and how to make a prediction with a trained logistic regression model. It then discusses what type of decision boundary logistic regression learns. Finally, discusses when and when not to use logistic regression.
